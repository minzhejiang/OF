# CRISPR
For this project, I made a mask with plaster and using Processing and Leap Motion sensor to visualize how CRISPR technology can upgrade genetically engineering in a dramatically better, cheaper and faster way. 

To play this App, you can use your hand to draw a random perfect face with different features from a big database. As you can see here, instead of natural selecting beneficial genes generation after generation. Right now you can just combine good genes in one embryo in just one generation.  What is CRISPR? It's actually like a genetic Swiss army knife with different tools in it, and one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass or a GPS for our DNA, so it can home in on a certain spot.  The next tool is like scissors that can cut the DNA right in that spot.  Finally, we have a pen where we can literally rewrite the genetic code in that location.
